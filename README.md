## Scripts

### `configure`

Each docker directory (`~/docker` and `~/media`) has a `configure` script that allows to configure the related `docker-compose.yml` file. It must be run once before starting the containers. They can be started using `nas` script (see below) or `docker-upgrade [docker|media]`

### `fix-plex-transcoder`

`fix-plex-transcoder` grants the required rights on `/dev/dri` for Plex [Hardware-Accelerated Streaming](https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002178853-using-hardware-accelerated-streaming/) feature to work correctly.

This script must be triggered from DSM Task Scheduler on boot-up using the `root` account in order to restore the permissions after a reboot.

### `fix-srt`

`fix-srt` allows to fix `.srt` subtitle files so they work correctly with Plex. Basically, it ensures that all files end with at least 2 empty lines.

### `nas`

`nas` installs/upgrades/fixes/starts all features mentioned above. Logs are available in `~/.log/nas.log`.

### `tvshows`

`tvshows` allows to download automatically new tv shows from a remote server, fix their permissions (using `sudo`) and send them to Medusa's post-processing. Configuration is located in `~/.tvshows`. Logs are available in `~/.log/tvshows.log`.

`tvshows` automatically impersonates the user configured for media services so the script can be run from root as well as from the configured user. It allows to easily schedule `tvshows`.

## Media

By default, all media services (Plex, Plex Webhook for BetaSeries, Tautulli, Medusa, Radarr and Ubooquity) use the following locations:

- `~/.docker`: contains the configuration of each service
- `/volume1/media`: contains all media files (i.e. `books`, `comics`, `movies`, `music`, `tvshows`)

This `media` directory is customizable (thanks to the `configure` script) but it must be created using DSM before configuring docker containers. All required subdirectories will then be created automatically, as well as `downloads/movies` and `downloads/tvshows` subdirectories.
